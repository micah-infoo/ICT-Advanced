	<h3>FORMATION OF KAKUMA REFUGEE CAMP.</h3>
	<p class="cc">Kakuma Refugee Camp, located in northwestern Kenya, was established in 1992 to accommodate the influx of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring countries, particularly Sudan, Somalia, and Ethiopia. The camp was initially set up to house the “Lost Boys of Sudan,” a group of young boys who were displaced or orphaned during Sudan’s Second Civil War. This conflict, which lasted from 1983 to 2005, displaced millions of people, forcing many to seek refuge in neighboring countries.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in collaboration with the Kenyan government and other humanitarian organizations, facilitated the establishment of the camp. Kakuma was chosen for its remote location, which provided a relatively safe haven away from border conflicts. The camp’s initial population of about 12,000 quickly grew as more refugees arrived from different parts of the region, escaping political instability, ethnic violence, and famine.

Over the years, Kakuma has transformed into a sprawling settlement that provides shelter, food, and basic services such as education and healthcare to its residents. The camp is divided into sections to accommodate refugees from diverse backgrounds, including South Sudanese, Congolese, Somali, and others. Despite its challenging environment, Kakuma has become a hub of resilience, with refugees engaging in entrepreneurship, education, and cultural exchanges.
